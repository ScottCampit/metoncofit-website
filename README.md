# MetOncoFit interactive explorer
The MetOncoFit interactive explorer was built on top of a Flask framework using Dash and Plotly. 

This application shows three heatmaps corresponding to increased, neutral, and decreased expression levels in all cancer models for predicting differential expression, copy number variation, and patient survival.

### In progress
The following features are currently being developed:
  * Interactive dotplots, barplots, and other exploratory data analysis plots
  * Uploadable metabolic models and real-time model training / testing

### Release Notes
  * Version 1.0: Heatmaps and interactive dash board for each cancer cell line model.
